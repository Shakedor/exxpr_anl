This scripts creates a graph detailing the difference in expressions of genes in two samples.
The script uses the library expression_r_functions.R, the functions of which are detailed below. 


expression script: get numeric table and graphical parameters, and plot the data from the table
-graph_name: name of the output graph (a single string)
-xaxis: name of the horizontal axis (a single string)
-yaxis: name of the vertical axis (a single string)
-size: size of the points in the plot (numeric)
-color: color of the points in the plot (name of color)
-reg: whether to plot a regression line ("y" or "n". default - "n")
-xfile: the name (or path) of the file containing the data for the x axis (a single string)
-yfile: the name (or path) of the file containing the data for the y axis (a single string)
-legend: whether to add a legend to the plot ("y" or "n". default - "n")
-names: if there's a legend, specify the names that appear in the legend (multiple strings, as many as needed)
-selected: quadruplets of size color reg(y/n) file

1. If there're no names provided and a legend is required:
 a. The default name of the basic plot series (not the "selected" series) is "All Genes"
 b. The default name of each series in the plot is the file name (in the selected quadruplet), without the whole path.
2. The number of names provided should be the number of selected quadruplets + 1. That's because the legend containes the basic series and the series that match each selected quadruplet.



getargs:
Get the arguments for the script, returns them in a parsed list.
Receives the arguments detailed above.

generateTable:
Load all countfiles of base and mutant into a table.

cleanTableNoZeros:
Remove zeroes from the table

generatePlots:
Plots the main data.
Receives the full table and the list of arguments for the script.
